I am Muhamad Fakhrusy.  
I am a muslim, I am not ashamed to say it loudly.  
I am a self-declared linux-enthusiast and computer-geek. Yes, I declare that offically!  
I am a lone wolf, I prefer do things alone. Reason? Personal preferences.  
I think it is sufficient for simple introduction!  



You can find me on
